# Capture-the-Flag
Built a large-scale two-player game that involves two players interacting with the keyboard to capture each otherâ€™s flags to win and return to their starting "den" to win the game. The game is played on a 2-D tile-based pseudorandomly generated world with a limited field of view for each player as the added layer of challenge.
